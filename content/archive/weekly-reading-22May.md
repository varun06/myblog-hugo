This week again I read more that 20 articles. I have a good mix of long form reading and quick reading articles. I read way more general(Science, Society etc.) compare to technical articles. Again Pocket app was handy to keep the articles saved for me.This logging has helped me in finding that I am reading a lot of stuff. I also have some books to read, so I might not read these many articles going forward and finish my books first.
