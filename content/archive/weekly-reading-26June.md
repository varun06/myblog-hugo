This weeks reading mostly included some highly popular articles from around the web. I read more documentation compared to technical articles from web.

#### General:

* http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/opinion/sunday/think-less-think-better.html

TL;DR: When you think too much you miss the moment and miss what is happening around you. It rings true to me. Specially in my case, it should be "Read less, Read Better".

This felt very personal. I have been asking same question(my situation is not as bad as author, but still). I am also trying to manage my information consumption and hence these writings. 

* http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/

TL;DR - Robots are coming

* http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21701265-how-minimise-damage-britains-senseless-self-inflicted-blow-tragic-split

TL;DR - Not good for UK, not for EU

* https://aeon.co/essays/the-body-as-amusement-park-a-history-of-masturbation

TL;DR - It's complicated.
	
#### Technical:

* http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2953944

TL:DR - speed of light sucks.

* http://www.confluent.io/blog/how-to-choose-the-number-of-topicspartitions-in-a-kafka-cluster/

TL:DR - choose your partitions carefully

* https://medium.com/linode-cube/configuration-management-4-tools-reviewed-7233eb44e278#.jpj5mr2op

TL:DR - There are many configuration management tools. Choose the one that work for you.

* http://dave.cheney.net/2016/06/24/gophers-please-tag-your-releases

TL;DR - tag your release, it is good for everybody.

* http://www.cyberciti.biz/howto/shell-primer-configuring-your-linux-unix-osx-environment/

TL;DR - Know your tools.
