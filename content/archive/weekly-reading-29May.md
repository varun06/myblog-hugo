This week I read more technical articles then general articles. Also I spent more time reading my kindle books. I am reading two books [Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PWX7RPG) and [Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/evolution-Phoenix-Horizon-Book-ebook/dp/B00OM9OKEC).
