This week I got a chance to attend a 2 day training on ["Basics of distributed trainings"](https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class) by [Aphyr](https://aphyr.com/). It was a great learning experience and I learned more about distributed systems. Kyle is a great guy and he answered our questions, helped us reason about our existing systems too. I will suggest anybody who is interested in distributed systems, to attend this class at least once.
