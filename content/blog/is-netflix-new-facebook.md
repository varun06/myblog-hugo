Whenever there is a new show/movie on netflix that I like, I will watch it. Sometimes those shows are 10-13 episodes long and that means, investing 10-13 hours in watching TV. I remember when I started using Facebook, I was spending lots of time on Facebook too, If I wasn't, I was getting FOMO. Same thing is happening with Netflix now, If I watch all those new cool shows, I end up spending way too much time watching TV, If not, then there is FOMO.
