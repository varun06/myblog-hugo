title = "Sunday reading the privileged immigrant"

+++

I was checking some tweets on twitter and came through one that mentioned an article [The priviliged immigrant](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/opinion/sunday/the-privileged-immigrant.html). The article is written by an author who is of Indian descent. Author talks about hard work her parents did when they came to United States in 1965. Then she talked about her gardener who is a Mexican and seems like an undocumented worker. 

There is a period of uncertainty because of recent elections. Lots of people are talking about immigration. This is an article that talk about some immigrants and two sides of this immigrant debate(legal vs illegal).
