Generics in Golang is a topic that everybody loves to talk :). There have been lots of articles on golang and generics such as [this](http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/golang-has-generics/), [this](http://bouk.co/blog/idiomatic-generics-in-go/) and [this](http://blog.ralch.com/tutorial/golang-code-generation-and-generics/). You can see it is a favorite topics of golang developers to talk about (My team personally discuss lack of generics in golang at least once a week).

I found [this](https://appliedgo.net/generics/) article about generics on reddit and found it very informative. I hope this is helpful to you as I found it helpful for me.
