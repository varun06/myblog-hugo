I was looking to read a book about economics from some time. I came across this book and immediately picked it up. I am really glad that I decided to read this book. This book is one of the most concise and thoughtful work on economics.

### summary of the book

### Thoughts

Nobel laureate F.A. Hayek said, **there is "no other modern book from which the intelligent layman can learn so much about the basic truths of economics in so short a time.**
In my reading of this book, this definitely rings true. Many of the economics concepts are discussed here and they help in daily and current economic understanding even though book was written long time back.
