# Books I read in 2014

I read 7 books (and ton of artilcles in [pockets](http://getpocket.com/) app) this year.

Most of the books that I read were technical ranging on different topics. I read couple of physics books such as [Hidden In Plain Sight 2: The Equation of the Universe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DFL353K/) and [The particles of universe](http://www.amazon.com/The-Particles-Universe-Jeff-Yee-ebook/dp/B007PM4ZZW).

I read one fiction book [Lethal Code](http://www.amazon.com/Lethal-Code-Lana-Elkins-Thriller-ebook/dp/B00J9P2EMO/), which I didn't like much. It had a great promise but writing could have been better.

For 2015, I am planning to read at least 15 books and will try to add some variety this time. I want to read some good fiction, non-fiction, science, technology books. I also have a backlog of 4-5 books that I need to finish this year.
