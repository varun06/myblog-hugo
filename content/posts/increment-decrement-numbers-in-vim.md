Vim is a text editor that keeps surprising you. The more you learn about vim,
there is always more to learn. One of the feature that I keep using and find
very interesting is incrementing/decrementing a number in current line. Vim has
`<ctrl-a>` to increment a number and `<ctrl-x>` to decrement a number. Just go to a
line with number in it and hit `<ctrl-a>/<ctrl-x>` to increment/decrement. But
because it is vim, there is definitely more to this command. You can also
provide a number to add/subtract using the same command. 

### Increment a number

`<ctrl-a>` to increment one time, we can also use `180<ctrl-a>` to add
180 to an existng number on line

### Decrement a number

`<ctrl-x>` to decrement one time, we can also use `180<ctrl-x>` to subtract 180
from a number on line
