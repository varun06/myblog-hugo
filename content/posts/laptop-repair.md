I haven't published anything on my blog because my personal laptop was having some issues. It is a mid 2012 retina Macbook Pro and I have it from last 4 years. It was `kernel panicking` and restarting every 5 minutes or so. I took it to Apple store and they ran some hardware tests. First they reinstalled the operating system and it did not help. I took it back for repair and they replaced the `logic board`. Apple charged a flat fee of `$310 + tax` for repairs. After repairs, laptop is working fine and I should be back to blooging now.
