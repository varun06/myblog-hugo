Do you really learn anything from technical videos-

I watch many technical videos. Mostly I found these videos shared on twitter by people I follow. I keep saving these videos in my watch it later list. 
When I start watching any of these videos, I have a feeling that I am going to learn something new after watching this video. But after 5 mins in video 
and I feel that i am not learning anything and it is turning into a time waster. 

Some reasons- 

1. Can't see code
2. Most of the things I already know

Things I tried-

1. Watch at faster speed
2. Taking notes 
3. Watching slow
