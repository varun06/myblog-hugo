What If 2: A sequel to What If. Pleasant and informative read. Like the humor and science intermingled in these books.

Rag Darbari: Another hindi book that I read this year. I liked this book a lot. A masterpiece in hindi writing. 

Elon Musk by Walter Issacson: Elon Musk is all the rage now a days and this book added some context to Elon Musk's story. I didn't like the writing much in this book though. 

Gunaho ka devta by Dharamveer Bharti: I have been trying to read more hindi literature lately. This is one of the books that I picked from India. This book is about love and Indian society at that time. The story touches on many themes such as castiesm, communism etc. I liked the writing a lot, but lost interest in story. I am not a big fan of romantic novel and non-fiction. Overall, great writing but didn't like the story much.
