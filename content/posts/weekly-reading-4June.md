Tracking my online article reading has been helpful so far. I am more aware about what to read and what not to read. I am no saving articles mindlessly to my **Pocket** app. This week I read an article about **reading and comprehending** [read less learn more](https://blog.todoist.com/2016/04/25/read-less-learn-more/), TL;DR when we read mindlessly we don't comprehend much, and we don't learn much. So idea is to learn more and read less. Also I read books from my kindle queue this week. I am done reading 50% of [(R)evolution (Phoenix Horizon Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OM9OKEC/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title).
