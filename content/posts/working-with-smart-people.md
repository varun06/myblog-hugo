# Working with samrt people

People write a lot about different ways to learn; Books, videos, teachers, and classes etc. But they don't give required recognition to one aspect of learning, that is working with smart and like minded people. It becomes more critical in a corporate environment. If you work with smart people, you learn so many things indirectly that you don't even recognize them.

Working with smart people help you on many levels, it helps you with your craft and it also helps you taking up new challenges and excel in them.

I am fortunate to work with many smart people in my current job and every day I learn new things just by discussing things with them.
