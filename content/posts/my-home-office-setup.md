I have been working from home for last 4 years. Initially I thought that I can get by a laptop and couch. But that's not how it played out. Very soon I realized that I need to have a proper home office setup if I want to work from home for a long duration. And here I am after 4 years. I have acquired quite a few things, and this is a running list of that.

## Computers

1. 2019 Macbook Pro(Office) - This is my work laptop, it is connected to 27 inch monitor. I keep this laptop hidden in a desk drawer. I use ergonomic Ergodox EZ glow keyboard as my main keyboard, this is a split keyboard and helps my right shoulder.

2. 2012 Macbook Pro(Personal) - This is my personal machine and I use it for blogging, personal project and other stuff.

3. Raspberry Pi(piHole and other stuff) - I use [piHole](https://pi-hole.net) to block advertisement for my whole house. I use a standalone raspberry pi.

## Desk

I have 3 desks in my home office room. 2 of those are from Ikea and 1 is a motorized satnding desk from Costco.

1. [Motorized Standing Desk](https://www.costcobusinessdelivery.com/tresanti-height-adjustable-standing-desk%2C-black.product.100359313.html)

2. [Manual Standing Desk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/thyge-desk-white-silver-color-s49110931/)

3. It is a custom one, I bought a white color table top and few table legs from Ikea, and assembled it in true Ikea fashion.  

## chair

[SteelCase Leap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H1QYBA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is my main working chair. I toggle between standing and sitting(70% standing, 30% sitting) while working. This is a great chair, I bought it on discounted rate. It has great customizability and comfort settings.

## Monitor

[LG 27UK850-W 27" 4K UHD IPS Monitor with HDR10 with USB Type-C Connectivity and FreeSync](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078GVTD9N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is my main work monitor. I like one screen at a time, so laptop is hidden. This monitor gives me enough screen space to work with.

### Keyboards

1. I use [Ergodox EZ Glow](https://ergodox-ez.com) as my keyboard. I started feeling some stiffness in my upper back and neck last year. After consulting doctor and bunch of x-rays, I decided that it was time to change my posture and use ergonomic accessories. This keyboard has been life saver. It some getting used to it, but I am back to my normal 55-60 WPM now. I also got interviewed by ergodox team and here is that interview - [Varun Saini](https://people.ergodox-ez.com/varun-saini/)

2. I like mechanical keyboard and also have a spare [WASD Code Keyboard](<https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-v2-87-modm.html>), I am not using it now a days, but I am sure I will find a way to use it soon.

## Accessories

### Audio

1. [Sennheiser HD6XX](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-sennheiser-hd6xx) for listening to music and zoom chat.

2. [Apple earphones](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector?fnode=2e5f5d4a64830ee8aa10bfdea47e2d580d6886c350ac013184baccda0495d7bef6ced53446ae58833c6905323bd9a9f73722bfa29b135b87d72232ebeee8af9ee07003328a46694e366ffda1f2415de068fc8a353a5a7c08d6e7db187b81fbed456aceb824d78b603a431fffb2afe6d3f33affc3dbad36a6d4ab8b00b807b273) for travel etc.

3. [Anker soundbuds curve](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/soundbuds-curve/A3263011) for working out and running.

4. [Ikea Symfonisk](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/symfonisk-wifi-bookshelf-speaker-white-80435211/) is used for music and podcast listening.

### Webcam

[Logitech 960](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Refurbished-Logitech-960-000715-C525-HD-Portable-Webcam-720p-USB-2-0/750650683) - I keep my laptop hidden and there are few disadvantages to that. We use zoom for video call and meetings in office. I was not able to use my laptop cam for video calls. So I bought this webcam from [Walmart](www.walmart.com). It has been great addition to my setup. Now I can use this webcam for both video and mic.
