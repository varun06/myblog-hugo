This book is a comprehensive introduction to recent indian history. As the title says, book looks at history after Mahatama Gandi and how it played out. Book is divided in chapters and there chapters are setup to read as individual units.

Author has done really good research and have given a whole lot of citations around interesting events. This is a long a fun read. If you are looking to learn about India's history around and after indipendence, this is one of the best book.

Overall I loved the book and will be reading more books from this author.
