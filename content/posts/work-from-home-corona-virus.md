Every company has been asking its employees to work from home because of ongoing Corona Virus pandemic. Becuase of this, There has been a great influx of articles about pros and cons of working from home. I have been working from home for last 3-4 years and here are some things that have worked fine for me.

### Having a fixed schedule
Having a fixed schedule really help. I start my work day at 9:00 AM and sign-off around 5:15 PM. I don't commute so all this time is working time.  

### Home Office
Having a home office is great. It is really helpful, If you have a place where you can close the door and get away from all the distraction.

### Always be communicating
Communication is the key in work from home. Communicate your failure and wins with the team.
