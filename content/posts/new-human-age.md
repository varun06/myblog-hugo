# HUMAN++

We all talk about an omnipotent AI that will come some time in future and might kill (hypothetically) its masters (humans in this case). I will love to have intelligent robots but I don't see it happening soon. What I believe will happen before AI take over the world, human++, more intelligent humans. If we look carefully we will see subtle changes and technical breakthroughs that are happening around us and pointing towards a brave new world. Some people call this phenomena "Singularity" but I call it human++.


There are many cutting edge research and experiments happening to make this a reality. Some of these are mentioned below and well worth you time to check out.

**1. Nano-bots and biological uses**

**2. Human Mind interface**

**3. Exoskeletons**

**4. Fight against aging :**

All the things and others will make humans more intelligent, more resilient to disease and other medical issues, more powerful and may be someday Immortal.


I am no scientist or philosopher, I am just a mere human who sees the things changing around him and trying to connect the dots. It is not easy to understand what is going on but I am an optimist and believe all these changes will make humans better and might one day make us an inter galactic species.


**We all know that AI is good, but you know what is best, more intelligent humans.**
