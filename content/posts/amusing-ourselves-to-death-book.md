**Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business is a book by educator Neil Postman**. I came to know about this book from one of [seenunseen](https://seenunseen.in/) episodes. you can see a pattern here, much of my reading recently is inspired by that single podcast. 

### summary of the book:

This book takes reader through the history media and how changes in media impacted sociatey in general(good or bad). This book was written in 1985, and focuses on how television negatively affected the level of public discourse in America. After reading the book I felt that itâ€™s even more relevant today in the internet era. All the readings and insights from the book fit really well in today's world and how internet also changed the public discourse.

### Thoughts

Book is an eye opening read and informs the reader a lot about how media and mediums can impact nations and people. This is a must read for anyone who wants to fortify his/her mind against tricks played by media/internet is current world.
