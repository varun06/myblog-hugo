I find podcasts informative and entertaining. Every week I listen to at least 3-4 hours of podcasts. I can only listen to podcasts when I am in gym or in car. I can not listen while working because of distraction and I do not want to be hit by cars, so I also do not listen while walking. But it seems that I can still get at least 4-5 hours every week and that's enough time to listen to most of these podcasts. 

These are the podcasts that I listen to:

* [Inquiring minds](http://www.motherjones.com/category/secondary-tags/inquiring-minds) - This is my favorite science podcast. The topics are diverse and hosts are really good. 
* [Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/) - Who would not like Planet Money. It is informative and interesting at the same time. 
* [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) - A podcast about design, architecture and other interesting things related to them. 
* [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/category/freakonomics-radio/podcasts/) - This is my favorite too. If you are interested in economics/phycology and their impacts on world, Do not miss this podcast.
* [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) - My only dev podcast. Scott Hanselman  talks to people about different technologies and ideas.
* [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) - This is also a popular podcast. Topics are diverse and interesting. 
* [The Nerdist](http://nerdist.com/podcasts/nerdist-podcast-channel/) - If you like stand up comedy and want to listen to some interesting people talk in very open environment, this is the podcast for you.

I also listen to some other podcasts if I find some interesting topic, otherwise these are the podcast that I listen to.
