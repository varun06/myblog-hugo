Shoe Dog is memoir by Nike founder Phil Knight. Book talks about how he founded Blue Ribbons and then fought for the company. How Nike got its signature shoes and what else happened in this journey.

### Things I liked

Book is exhaustive and talks about both successes and failures. Language of the book is easy and there is a flow to the story.

### Thing I wished were there

I wish author talked about whole Jordan saga. He totaly skipped that part. I know there is a movie about Jordan and Nike, but reading his perspective could have been great.
