This week I didn't read too many online articles. But still found some good technical articles that I read.

http://videlalvaro.github.io/2015/02/programming-myths.html

	The real problem is forming our opinion very quicky without thinking a bit and looking at the context. Are "Goto" really harmful in computer programming or it is just a myth. This Statement by Donanld Knuth summerise this whole article -
	"We shouldn’t merely remove go to statements because it’s the fashionable thing to do; the presence or absence of go to statements is not really the issue."

	Some great quotes from article:

	"we should strive most of all for a program that is easy to understand and almost sure to work"

	"the universal experience of programmers who have been using measurement tools has been that their intuitive guesses fail."

	"premature optimization is the root of all evil"

	"Experience indicates that nearly everybody has the wrong idea about the real bottlenecks in his programs"
