I love reading and read a lot. Mostly my reading is on topics related to programming, science, and social science. When I find an article worth reading I use (pocket)[https://getpocket.com] to store the article. Once I have 4-5 articles to read, I read them and then share them to twitter or facebook. Most of the reading happen on weekends and I also read some books too. Today morning I thought to start this section on my blog so that if someone find these articles enticing, they can also get the link to read them.
