Hiring is a difficult problem to solve(http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/why-is-it-so-hard-to-hire-great-people/277122/). Career fairs are a good way to meet college graduates who are looking for internship or full time opportunities. I have been to many career fairs and we found some really good engineers(some of them are my colleagues) there. But some time back I noticed that there are lots of students looking for data science or data analysts roles(both internship or full time). Even this year, I have been to two career fairs and I am amazed how many students wants to be data scientists or data analysts. I asked many current students why they want to be a data scientist or some time even "What is data science" but most of the time they don't know.

I don't know what is the reason and that's why I thought of asking smart people....
